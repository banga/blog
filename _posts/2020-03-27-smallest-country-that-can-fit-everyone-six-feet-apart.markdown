Today's [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2286/) got me wondering.
My answer: **Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹**.

## Methodology

If we want everyone to keep a minimum distance of $$r$$ from each other, the
problem boils down to efficiently packing $$n$$ circles of radius $$r$$ in the
smallest area possible. This can be calculated as follows:

Area of a circle with radius $$r$$,

$$A_r = \pi r^2 $$

Optimal circle packing density[^1],

$$\eta  = \frac{\pi\sqrt{3}}{6}$$

Area required for $$n$$ people,

$$
\begin{align}
    A_n & = n \cdot \frac{A_r}{\eta} \\
        & = n \cdot \frac{\pi r^2}{\frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{6}} \\
        & = 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot n \cdot r^2
\end{align}
$$

Plugging in the current world population[^2] and the recommended distance of 6 feet[^3]:

$$ n = \text{7,773,861,168} $$

$$ r = 6\text{ft} $$

we get

$$
\begin{align}
    A_n & = 9.695Ã—10^{11} \text{ft}^2 \\
        & = 34,775 \text{mi}^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

According to Wikipedia[^4], this is just shy of the land area of Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.
